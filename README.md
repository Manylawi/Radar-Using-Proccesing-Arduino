# Radar-Using-Proccesing-Arduino
This project presents a **radar simulation system** built using an **ultrasonic sensor** (HC-SR04), a **servo motor**, and an **Arduino Uno**, with real-time **graphical visualization** developed in **Processing IDE**. The system continuously scans a sector and displays detected objects and distances in a radar-like user interface.
